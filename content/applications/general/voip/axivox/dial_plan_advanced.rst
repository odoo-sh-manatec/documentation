==================
Dial plan advanced
==================

Companies have a lot of incoming calls every day, but many don't want their teams to answer calls
24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Using Axivox advanced dial plan features, the process can be
automated and plans can be setup for all scenarios. This way customers are never left waiting or
frustrated because they couldn't get in touch with anyone.

Using the advanced dial plans companies can automate plans for certain days or times, like company
holidays. Companies can also allow callers to enter extensions themselves and transferred
automatically using a digital receptionist, so an administrative team doesn't have to be available
around the clock. There is even the option, to route callers depending on where they're calling from
in the world, to maximize efficiently.
