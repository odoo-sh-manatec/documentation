Dial plan basics
================

When someone calls a business, they might need to get in touch with customer support, a sales team,
or even one person's direct line. The caller might also be in search of some information about the
business, such as store hours, or they might want to leave a voicemail, so someone from the company
can call them back. With dial plans in Axivox a company can manage how incoming calls are handled.

Using call architecture through a dial plan, callers get directed to the right people or to the
right information. This document will cover basic configuration of dial plans in Axivox.
