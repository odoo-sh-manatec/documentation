Dynamic caller ID
=================

Caller ID will identify the caller when they make a phone call. The recipient of the call can see
what number the caller is calling from. Caller ID show users and clients, who is calling, so they
can choose to pick up or decline the call.

Axivox offers a dynamic caller ID to choose which number is displayed on outgoing calls.
International numbers can be purchased to do business transactions internationally, via a phone call
from a number that has an area code or country code of the destination. By displaying a local
number, this can increase customer engagement.

Some companies have many employees making calls from a call center, these employees are not always
available to receive a return phone call back from a prospective customer. In this case, :abbr:`VoIP
(Voice over Internet Protocol)` can be configured in such a way that dynamic caller ID shows the
main company phone number so that any number of employees in the group can answer the call. This way
a call is never missed.
