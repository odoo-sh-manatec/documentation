Call queues
===========

A call queue is a system that organizes sand routes incoming calls. When customers call a business
and all of the agents are busy, the call queue lines up the callers in sequential order based on the
time they called in. The callers then wait on hold, to be connected to the next available call
center agent.

By implementing a call queue system in place, this reduces stress for employees, and helps build
brand trust with your customers. Many companies use call queues to help set expectations, distribute
the workload evenly amongst the team thus lowering call abandonment rates.

This document will cover configuring call queues (with advanced settings), as well as how to log
into a call queue from the Odoo database.
