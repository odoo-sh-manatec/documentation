Documents
=========

**Odoo Documents** allows you to store, view and manage files within Odoo.

You can upload any type of file (max 64MB per file on Odoo Online), and organize them in various
workspaces.

Configuration
=============

By going to :menuselection:`Documents --> Configuration --> Settings`, you can enable the
centralization of files attached to a specific area of your activity. For example, by ticking
:guilabel:`Human Resources`, your HR documents are automatically available in the HR workspace,
while documents related to Payroll are automatically available in the Payroll sub-workspace . You
can change the default workspace by using the dropdown menu and edit its properties by clicking the
internal link button (:guilabel:`➔`).

.. note::
   - If you enable the centralization of your accounting files and documents, it is necessary to
     click on :guilabel:`Journals` and define each journal independently to allow automatic
     synchronization.

   - If you select a new workspace, existing documents aren't moved. Only newly created documents
     will be found under the new workspace.

Workspaces
==========

Workspaces are hierarchical folders having their own set of tags and actions. Default workspaces
exist, but you can create your own by going to :menuselection:`Documents --> Configuration -->
Workspaces` and clicking on :guilabel:`New`. A new page pops up:

- :guilabel:`Name`: add the name of your workspace;
- :guilabel:`Parent Workspace`: if the workspace belongs to a parent workspace (and is then a
  sub-workspace), select it from the list;
- :guilabel:`Company`: if your workspace is only available to the selected company.

Tags
----

Tags are used within workspaces to add a level of differentiation between documents. They are
organized per category, and filters can be used to sort them.

Tags can be created from the :guilabel:`Tags` tab. Click :guilabel:`Add a line`, create the
:guilabel:`Tag Category`, and :guilabel:`Name` your tags. Go to the :guilabel:`Tooltip` tab to add
informative text for when users hover over your tag.

.. note::
   - The tags of a parent workspace apply to the child workspaces automatically;
   - Tags can be created and modified by going to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Tags`;
   - Tags can also be created, edited, or deleted, by clicking on the gear icon :guilabel:`⚙`, on
     the left menu.

Access rights
-------------

To manage your workspace access rights, go to :menuselection:`Documents --> Configuration -->
Workspaces`, open the workspace you want to edit, and go to the :guilabel:`Access Rights` tab.
You can add :guilabel:`Write Groups` that can see the workspace and read, create, and edit
its documents. You can also add :guilabel:`Read Groups` that can see the workspace and read its
documents without creating and editing rights.

Description
-----------

You can add descriptive information to your workspace by going to :menuselection:`Documents -->
Configuration --> Workspaces`, open the workspace you want to describe, and go to the
:guilabel:`Description` tab,

.. note::
   :guilabel:`Workspaces` and :guilabel:`Sub-workspaces` can also be created and edited by clicking
   on the gear icon :guilabel:`⚙` on the left menu.

Documents management
====================

When selecting or opening a document, the right panel displays different options. On the top,
additional options might be available: :guilabel:`Download`, :guilabel:`Share`, :guilabel:`Replace`,
:guilabel:`Lock` or :guilabel:`Split`. It is also possible to :guilabel:`Open chatter` or
:guilabel:`Archive` the document.

.. image:: documents/right-panel-options.png
   :align: center
   :alt: right panel options

Then, you can modify the name of your file by clicking on :guilabel:`Document`. A
:guilabel:`Contact` or an :guilabel:`Owner` can be assigned. The related :guilabel:`Workspace` can
be modified and it is possible to access the related :guilabel:`Journal Entry` or to add
:guilabel:`Tags`.

.. note::
   - The :guilabel:`Contact` is the person related to the document and assigned to it. He can only
     view the document and not modify it. I.e.: an existing supplier in your database is the contact
     for their bill.
   - The person who creates a document is, by default :guilabel:`Owner` of it and has complete
     rights to the document. It is possible to replace the owner of a document. I.e.: an employee
     must be owner of a document to be able to see it in "My Profile".

Different :ref:`Actions <documents/workflow-actions>` are available at the bottom of the right panel,
depending on the workspace where your document is stored.

Split documents
---------------

Select the document you want to split, and click the :guilabel:`Split` icon. A new view opens and
displays all the pages of the document.

The scissors between pages indicate where the split will occur. Click on the scissors if you
don't want to split your document between two specific pages. Click :guilabel:`Split` to split your
document.

.. image:: documents/split-pdf.png
   :align: center
   :alt: split your documents

.. note::
   To merge documents, select them from your dashboard and click the :guilabel:`Split` icon. Click
   on the scissors between pages to remove the cut, and click :guilabel:`Split` to merge the
   documents.

Additional features
-------------------

Select a workspace and click on the arrow next to the :guilabel:`Upload` button to access additional
features:

Request
~~~~~~~

You can create "missing documents" and organize them as documents, to remind users to download them.

Select the workspace where the file should be stored and click :guilabel:`Upload`, then
:guilabel:`Request`. Add the :guilabel:`Document name`, select the person you need it from in the
:guilabel:`Request to` field, fill in the :guilabel:`Due date`, confirm the :guilabel:`Workspace`,
the document should belong to, and add :guilabel:`Tags` and a :guilabel:`Note`, if needed. Then,
click :guilabel:`Request`. A file reflecting the missing document is created in the workspace.

You can see all missing documents by going to the :guilabel:`Activity` view and to the
:guilabel:`Requested Document` column.

.. Note::

   From the :guilabel:`Activity` view, you can send a **reminder email** to users you are waiting a
   document from. Go to the :guilabel:`Requested Document` column, click on ⋮, and
   :guilabel:`Document Request: Reminder`.

   Click on a date to see the details of a specific request. You can update it by clicking on the
   pen icon, :guilabel:`Preview` the content of the reminder email, or :guilabel:`Send Now` to send
   a reminder email.

   .. image:: documents/reminder-email.png
      :align: center
      :alt: send a reminder email from the Activity view

Add a link
~~~~~~~~~~

To add a link to your documents dashboard, click on :guilabel:`Add a link`, enter the
:guilabel:`URL`, and :guilabel:`Name` it. A file reflecting the url is created on your dashboard.

Share
~~~~~

Sharing a document, a sub-workspace, or an entire workspace with your contacts is possible.

To share the content of a workspace, select it and click :menuselection:`Upload --> Share`. A page
pops up, with a :guilabel:`URL` available. You can :guilabel:`Copy` it to share it with the users
you want so they can directly access your document workspace and its content. You can
:guilabel:`Name` the share link and set a validity date for the url by filling the
:guilabel:`Valid Until` field. Tick the :guilabel:`Include Sub Folders` box if you also want to
share sub-folders. You can also enable users to :guilabel:`Download` or
:guilabel:`Download and Upload` documents.

.. note::

   It is possible to only share one or more documents (without their workspace) by selecting them
   and clicking :guilabel:`Share`.

New spreadsheet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new spreadsheet, click :guilabel:`New Spreadsheet`. You can select a
:guilabel:`Blank spreadsheet` or an existing template.

.. _documents/workflow-actions:

Workflow actions
================

Workflow actions help manage documents and overall business operations. These are automated actions
that can be created and customized for each workspace. For example, create documents, process bills,
sign, organize files, add tags to a file, or move it to another workspace with a single click, etc.
These workflow actions appear on the right panel when they meet the set criteria.

Create workflow actions
-----------------------

To create workflow actions, go to :menuselection:`Documents --> Configuration --> Actions` and then
click on :guilabel:`New`.

.. note::
   An action applies to all :guilabel:`Child Workspaces` under the :guilabel:`Parent Workspace` you
   selected.

Set the conditions
------------------

You can :guilabel:`Create` a new :guilabel:`Action` or edit an existing one. You can define the
:guilabel:`Action Name` and then set the conditions that trigger the appearance of the action button
(:guilabel:`▶`) on the right-side panel when selecting a file.

There are three basic types of conditions you can set:

#. :guilabel:`Tags`: you can both use the :guilabel:`Contains` and :guilabel:`Does not contain`
   conditions, meaning the files *must have* or *mustn't have* the tags set here.

#. :guilabel:`Contact`: the files must be associated with the contact set here.

#. :guilabel:`Owner`: the files must be associated with the owner set here.

.. image:: documents/basic-condition-example.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Example of a workflow action's basic condition in Odoo Documents

.. tip::
   If you don't set any conditions, the action button appears for all files located inside the
   selected workspace.

Advanced condition type: domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::
   It is recommended to have some knowledge of Odoo development to properly configure *Domain*
   filters.

To access the :guilabel:`Domain` condition from the :guilabel:`Actions` tab, the :ref:`developer
mode <developer-mode>` needs to be activated. Once that's done, select the :guilabel:`Domain`
condition type, and click on :guilabel:`Add condition`.

To create a rule, you typically select a :guilabel:`field`, an :guilabel:`operator`, and a
:guilabel:`value`. For example, if you want to add a workflow action to all the PDF files inside a
workspace, set the :guilabel:`field` to *Mime Type*, the :guilabel:`operator` to *contains*, and the
:guilabel:`value` to *pdf*.

.. image:: documents/domain-condition-example.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Example of a workflow action's domain condition in Odoo Documents

Click on :guilabel:`Add New Rule` (plus icon) and :guilabel:`Add branch` to add conditions and
sub-conditions. You can then specify if your rule should match :guilabel:`all` or :guilabel:`any`
conditions. You can also edit the rule directly using the :guilabel:`Code editor`.

Configure the actions
---------------------

Select the :guilabel:`Actions` tab to set up your action. You can simultaneously:

- **Set Contact**: add a contact to the file, or replace an existing contact with a new one.
- **Set Owner**: add an owner to the file, or replace an existing owner with a new one.
